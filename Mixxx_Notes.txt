I have just realized that i can not sort the playlist in mixxl to be sorted
according to bpm. So i guess a user will be saving the playlist to an external
file. My own code will load the next appropriate song based on its bpm and it to
auto dj playlist

In the normal table track view/ on the decks, i can make there to be a command
to log a music mixx and cure points.

//There is the "library/playlisttablemodel.h"
#include "track/track.h"
#include "library/libraryview.h"
#include "library/library.h"
#include "library/trackcollection.h"
#include "library/playlisttablemodel.h"
#include "widget/wtracktableview.h"

study these
and there is sorting in #include "widget/wtracktableview.h"
